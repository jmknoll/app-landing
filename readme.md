## Introduction

This is a basic design template for the promotion of mobile app. I've written a lot of the boilerplate here, so you don't have to! Simply customize as much or as little as you see fit, build with Grunt, and deploy. 


## Getting Started

This template was built with yeoman's [generator-webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp), so getting started is as painless as can be!

Simply clone the repo, and run `npm install` & `bower install` to install the neccesary dependencies.

Serve with `grunt serve`, and build a production-ready, CDNified distribution with 'grunt'.

_If you don't have grunt installed already, install it with `npm install -g grunt`, and you should be good to go! See [here](http://yeoman.io/codelab/prepare-production.html), or [here](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp) for more information._
